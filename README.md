For creation of this site used React features Redux, Redux toolkit, CreateBrowserRouter, useEffect, useFetcher, useLoaderData, useNavigation, useParams, useRouterError etc. This project is a self-built recreation based on a course by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy. All rights belong to the original author. I built this as a learning exercise to strengthen my frontend development skills
